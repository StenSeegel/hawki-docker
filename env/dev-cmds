# HAWKI - Development Post-Deployment Commands
# =====================================================
# This file contains Artisan commands that will be
# executed at the end of development deployment.
#
# Useful for automated test user creation, demo data
# seeding, or other development-specific setup tasks.
#
# Note: The 'texts:seed' command is already executed
# automatically in the main deployment script, so you
# don't need to add it here.
#
# Format: One command per line (without 'php artisan')
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored
#
# File: _docker/env/dev-cmds
# =====================================================

# user:create-test --student

# Example: Import test data
# import:test-users

# Example: Run custom seeders
